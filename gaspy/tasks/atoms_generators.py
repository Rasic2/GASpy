'''
This submodule contains various tasks that generate `ase.Atoms` objects.
The output of all the tasks in this submodule are actually dictionaries (or
"docs" as we define them, which is short for Mongo document). If you want the
atoms object, then use the gaspy.mongo.make_atoms_from_doc function on the
output.

                    shift              Float indicating the shift/termination of

                    top                Boolean indicating whether or not the slab

                                       it was enumerated originally by pymatgen

                                       x and y directions before site enumeration
                    adsorption_site    `np.ndarray` of length 3 containing the
                                       containing the cartesian coordinates of the

                                       where the origin is (0.,0.,0.). The adsorbate is
                                       placed along the adsorption vector so it is normal
                                       to the local plane of slabs.

class GenerateAllSitesFromBulk(luigi.Task):
    '''
    This task will enumerate all the adsorption sites from a single bulk.

    Luigi normally likes unit tasks (i.e., a task that adds only one site to
    the catalog, instead of a bunch), but this would end up spawing millions
    of tasks, which Luigi is not fast at handling. So we instead make this
    task, so Luigi only has to handle O(X0,000) tasks.

    Args:
        mpid                    A string indicating the Materials Project ID of
                                the bulk you want to enumerate sites from
        max_miller              An integer indicating the maximum Miller index
                                to be enumerated
        min_xy                  A float indicating the minimum width (in both
                                the x and y directions) of the slab (Angstroms)
                                before we enumerate adsorption sites on it.
        slab_generator_settings We use pymatgen's `SlabGenerator` class to
                                enumerate surfaces. You can feed the arguments
                                for that class here as a dictionary.
        get_slab_settings       We use the `get_slabs` method of pymatgen's
                                `SlabGenerator` class. You can feed the
                                arguments for the `get_slabs` method here
                                as a dictionary.
        bulk_vasp_settings      A dictionary containing the VASP settings of

                        task for specifics regarding the structure of the
                        dictionaries. This task will also add the 'miller'
                        key to each dictionary, and the values will be a
